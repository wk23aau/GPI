PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES
AI Quality Engineer / Machine Learning Engineer
Archopinion | London, UK	Jan 2024 – Present | Part-Time
Designing quality gates and testing strategies for an AI-driven document analysis platform.
	AI System Testing: Developed the test strategy for complex NLP and Computer Vision models. ensuring high accuracy and reliability before deployment to production.
	Python Automation: Wrote Python scripts to automate data validation pipelines, checking large datasets for consistency and "poisoned" data—critical for model integrity.
	Infrastructure QA: Managed Docker containers for model inference, conducting performance testing to ensure the system remained stable under GPU-intensive loads.
	CI/CD Implementation: Integrated automated quality checks into the deployment pipeline, ensuring that only models meeting specific accuracy thresholds were released.
	Collaboration: Worked daily with Data Scientists to define "testability" for non-deterministic AI outputs.
Senior Software Engineer (Backend & Systems Quality)
Al Yamama Company | NEOM (The LINE), Saudi Arabia	Jan 2023 – Jan 2024 | Full-Time
Focused on the reliability of distributed tracking systems and infrastructure.
	Distributed Systems Testing: Validated a distributed RFID tracking system across multiple physical sites, mirroring the complexity of federated networks.
	Linux & Scripting: Maintained Linux-based servers, using Bash scripts to automate system health checks and log rotation.
	API & Database QA: Built automated API tests to verify secure data transmission between local nodes and the central cloud, ensuring data privacy and integrity.
	Performance Engineering: Optimized PostgreSQL queries and backend logic to handle high-concurrency data streams.
QA Automation Engineer
Amigo Software| Lahore, Pakistan	Oct 2020 – Dec 2023 | Full-Time
Core QA role for "Rainbow Classroom," a real-time web communication platform.
	Test Automation Frameworks: Contributed to the development of automated test suites for a real-time communication platform (Rainbow Classroom).
	Pipeline Management: Helped enforce quality gates in the release process, preventing critical bugs from reaching the production environment.
	Root Cause Analysis: Investigated complex backend failures, using logs and monitoring tools to provide actionable feedback to developers.
Frontend Web Developer / Tester
Eyecix Solutions| Lahore, Pakistan	July 2019 – Oct 2020 | Full-Time
	Foundation in Code: Developed responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
	White Box Testing: This developer background allows me to perform "Grey Box" testing, as I can read the source code to understand exactly why a UI bug is occurring.
TECHNICAL SKILLS
	Core Language: Python (Advanced scripting, Automation, PyTest), Bash.
	Infrastructure & DevOps: Docker (Containerization), Kubernetes concepts, Linux/UNIX administration, CI/CD (GitHub Actions/Pipelines as Code).
	AI & Data QA: Model Evaluation, Data Integrity Testing, Federated Learning concepts, GPU resource monitoring, Pandas/NumPy.
	Testing: Automated Testing (Backend/API), Non-functional Testing (Performance/Scalability), Security/Privacy validation.
CORE SKILLS
	Frontend Automation: Cypress, Selenium, JavaScript/TypeScript, Playwright.
	Manual & UI Testing: Cross-browser Testing, Responsive Design Validation, WCAG Accessibility, DOM Debugging.
	Web Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, React, Next.js, REST APIs (Postman).
	Processes & Tools: Agile/Scrum, Jira, Git, Jenkins, GitLab CI, SQL.
	Domain Experience: Regulatory Compliance, Enterprise Systems, Data Security.

PROJECTS
	HiddenSentimentNLP (MSc):
	Developed a transformer-based NLP system to detect implicit or hidden sentiment in user-generated content. Integrated a live web scraping module to extract real-time product reviews from Amazon and deployed the model directly onto a user-facing interface for instant inference. Demonstrated full-stack capability by combining data extraction, inference API, and front-end display for live prediction.
	Offline Tracker - Lost & Found (BSCS):
	Designed and implemented a GSM-based location tracking system using encrypted SMS communication between paired mobile apps and a web interface (Twilio API). Enabled secure, internet-independent location sharing and recovery of lost or stolen devices through automated SMS requests and encrypted coordinate responses.
	JD2CVs (MVP):
	Conceived, designed, and deployed a full-stack web application that allows users to paste a job description and receive a CV that is interactive with live editing interface allowing users to directly modify and refine their CV content either visual or textual in real-time within the browser by commanding AI or manual customization.
